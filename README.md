# Object-detection-YoLoV8
A custom object detection project where I prepared the dataset, converted annotations to YOLO format, applied augmentation, and trained a YOLOv8 model using transfer learning. Achieved mAP50 of 0.83 and built an automated inference pipeline to generate predictions and CSV outputs.
